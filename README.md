# Codewars-Solutions
The parser works on a text file comprized of my solutions (copied from my completed solutions page in codewars).

With some minor formatting of the solutions file (remove the leading and trailing text), this should work for anyone who wants to use it.

Once you have a file, save it over `SolutionParser/SplitSolutions/bin/Debug/solutions.txt`, and run the parser.

If you run into errors, you likely have used a language that I have not and will need to add your languages and file extensions to the `fileExtensions` dictionary.
